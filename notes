to run the agent and world,
1. rm *.txt
2. in one shell run: python turnStepWorldNest.py (and enter the l or f command)
3. in another run: python turnStepAgentNest.py

The main world module is turnStepWorldNest.py which is mostly tk.
It uses spkeServeNest.py.  It's got extra code that needs to be removed.
The agent is (obviously) turnStepAgentNest.py.  It uses 
nealCoverClass
parseClass
stateMachineClass and
turnStepLang
x
You probably want to modify turnStepLang to include turn right.
Then fix up the agent and all the communication so that you get that.

Then copy it all, and make a four command chatbot.
If you get that going, you're in pretty good shape.
